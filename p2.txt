Project 2 - JS APIs and Data
Objectives
event handling
json data
api consumption
Project Details
Create a page that allows a user to enter a zip code. Based on the zip code, the application will render weather data from http://www.geonames.org/.
Create a free account on http://www.geonames.org/ that allows for api access
Change your http://www.geonames.org/ account to allow for free service requests
Create page that has an input field for a zip code along with a "Get Weather" button
The "Get Weather" button will search http://www.geonames.org/ based on the user-entered zip code. The goal of the zip code based search is to determine the latitude and longitude (use http://api.geonames.org/postalCodeSearchJSON) of the selected zip code as well as grab the city name.
Once you have retrieved the latitude and longitude coordinates, you can then make an additional request to http://www.geonames.org/. The follow up request (use http://api.geonames.org/findNearByWeatherJSON) will gather a weather observation that includes temperature and wind information.
The temperature reading is in Celsius. You should convert the temperature to Farenheit. If the Farenheit temperature is 34° or colder, you should add a cold icon to the ouput (next to the temperature). If the Farenheit temperature is 83° or warmer, you should add a hot icon to the output (next to the temperature).
If wind conditions are greater than 15 mph. you should a wind icon next to the wind conditions.
